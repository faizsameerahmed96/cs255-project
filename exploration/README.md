- Create a way to specify custom coordinates (test case), text file
- Show test case and output in some file
- Save output in output files.
- Give option to input test case, save test case and output. If user does not provide test case, randomly generate. User specifies number of cities.

Slides Action Items
- More test cases for number of cities (2 per number of cities)
- Compare genetic and held karper
- Add more description on genetic algorithm, (parameters), held karper
- Runtime increase of genetic algorithm and solution quality, compare with held karper (upto 20)
- Remove other slides, make it simple
